                    The Bridge of Sighs is one of Venice's most famous landmarks, connecting the Doge's Palace to the old prison. Completed in 1602, its name is believed to reflect the sighs of prisoners as they took their last glimpse of the beautiful city before their imprisonment. The bridge is an exquisite example of Baroque architecture, featuring delicate stonework and an arched design. Visitors can admire it from the outside or take a gondola ride for a unique perspective, making it a poignant symbol of Venice's history
